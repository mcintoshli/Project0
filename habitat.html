        Musk Turtles are aquatic turtles and love their homes to be mostly filled with water. They need a spot to bask, a place to hide, and a substrate such as rocks to make them feel like they are out in nature.
        Basking spots can be a shallow place or an actual dock that is above the water. These places should have a UV (ultra-violet) heat lamp to provide heat for your turtle and to provide them important vitamin D.
        This is important because musk turtles cannot metabolise calcium properly which causes bone growth problems. It may take your turtle a while to first start basking as musk turtle prefer spending their time in
        the water. Since they spend most of their time in the water it might be a good idea to get a underwater filter.  These little guys are pretty dirty because of their diet and a filter will help with keeping the water clean.
        In addition to a water filter you could invest in a water heater to keep the temperature of the water at a comfortable 72-80F range. As long as you have a warm clean tank, your musk turtle will be very happy.
